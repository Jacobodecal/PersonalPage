### 1. Infrastructure: Running Your Own Always-On AI Layer

We finally have the ingredients to run a real personal AI assistant.
Frontier models like Claude Opus 4.6 can reason across long context,
synthesize complex information, and generate structured outputs.
Orchestration layers like OpenClaw abstract the plumbing. Cheap cloud
compute makes it practical to keep everything online 24/7.

The result is simple but powerful: an assistant you can message from
your phone that helps you think faster and execute with less friction.
Research, analysis, drafting, planning, coding support, decision
structuring --- all through a single interface that is always available.

The infrastructure to run this is not expensive. In my case, I use a
Hetzner CAX21 instance, which costs €6.99 per month (roughly \$7--8
depending on exchange rates). The machine runs on ARM architecture and
includes 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, and 80GB of NVMe storage. This is more than
enough because no heavy AI inference happens locally. The server runs
coordination logic only. The actual reasoning happens through the Claude
API.

In practice, the VPS handles session state, Telegram updates, and model
orchestration. CPU usage remains modest because the workload is mostly
network-bound rather than compute-bound. You are not running a model
cluster. You are running coordination infrastructure.

That distinction is what keeps the cost low and the architecture
elegant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Deploying the VPS and Preparing the Environment

Go to:

https://console.hetzner.cloud/

Create a new server with:

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\
Instance type: CAX21\
Add your SSH key (recommended)

If you add an SSH key during provisioning, you will be able to log in
without a password. Otherwise, Hetzner will generate a root password.

Connect via SSH:

``` bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

If using password authentication, you will be prompted to paste the root
password.

Once inside the machine, update and prepare the environment:

``` bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y git curl ca-certificates
```

At this stage, you have a clean Linux environment running continuously
in the cloud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Installing Node.js and OpenClaw

OpenClaw runs on Node.js. Install Node 20 LTS:

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs
node -v
npm -v
```

Because the CAX21 runs on ARM64, if you choose Node 22 instead of 20,
you may need to install build tools to compile native dependencies:

``` bash
apt install -y build-essential make g++ pkg-config python3 libopus-dev
```

Now install OpenClaw globally:

``` bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

If installation throws errors, copy the full error output and paste it
into Claude. Frontier models are extremely good at debugging Node
dependency issues, ARM build failures, missing packages, and PATH
problems. Most installation issues can be resolved this way quickly.

Verify installation:

``` bash
openclaw --help
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Configuring OpenClaw and Connecting Claude Opus

Instead of manually exporting environment variables, use the OpenClaw
configuration wizard:

``` bash
openclaw config
```

Follow the prompts carefully.

When asked for your model provider credentials, enter your Anthropic API
key.\
When prompted to select a model, choose Claude Opus 4.6.

The configuration will be stored under:

    ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

At this point, your assistant has a reasoning layer connected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Creating and Connecting Your Telegram Bot

Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.

Start a conversation and run:

    /newbot

BotFather will ask for a display name and a username (which must end in
"bot"). Once created, it will generate a token. Copy this token.

Back on your VPS:

``` bash
openclaw channels login --channel telegram
```

Paste the token when prompted.

Choose pairing mode for DM policy.

Now send a message to your bot from your Telegram account. You will
receive a pairing code. Approve it:

``` bash
openclaw pairing approve telegram YOUR_PAIRING_CODE
```

If you want to restrict usage strictly to your own Telegram ID:

``` bash
openclaw config set channels.telegram.dmPolicy allowlist
openclaw config add channels.telegram.allowFrom "YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Starting the Gateway and Keeping It Online

Start the OpenClaw gateway:

``` bash
openclaw gateway --host 127.0.0.1
```

To keep it running even after closing SSH, use tmux:

``` bash
apt install -y tmux
tmux new -s assistant
openclaw gateway --host 127.0.0.1
```

Detach with:

CTRL + B\
then press D

Reattach later:

``` bash
tmux attach -t assistant
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. What Happens When You Send a Message

When you message your Telegram bot, the request flows to the OpenClaw
gateway on your VPS. The gateway attaches session context and forwards
structured input to Claude Opus. Claude performs inference remotely and
returns a response. The gateway routes that response back through
Telegram.

The server remains lightweight because it performs coordination, not
inference. Claude handles reasoning at scale via API. The VPS simply
orchestrates the interaction.

For roughly seven dollars per month in infrastructure, you now operate a
persistent AI layer that is always reachable, isolated from your laptop,
and fully under your control.
