Nowadays there's a lot of attention and people talking about Artificial Intelligence, the impact of this technology into our society, that AI is gonna take our jobs, is gonna reshape the world and finally dominate the humans.

We need to take a step back and understand more about this scenario and the technological triggers that are thriving this revolution. When we talk about Artificial Intelligence we basically are saying that exists an algorithmic intelligence that runs over a bunch of data, and as we increase this among of data being analyzed we increase the number of insight and the potential of the Artificial Intelligence. What i'm saying is that without Data Capture we don't have AI.

With this in mind we can start understanding the power of IoT as a real world data capture in our society and a AI Enabler for many rudimentary industries that are sweating for innovation like Industry & Logistics, Agriculture & Farming and many others real economy sectors. So what i want to tell you in this post is that IoT it's a deep technology that can bring innovation, connectivity and intelligence into a lot of economic sectors that did not have this privilege yet.

You will listen a lot of AIoT(Artificial Intelligence of Things) on the next months...
