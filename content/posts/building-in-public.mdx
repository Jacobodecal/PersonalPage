# Building in Public: Lessons from Portfolio Companies

Over the past few years, I've watched several founders embrace the "build in public" approach. Here's what I've learned from their experiences.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public means sharing your company's journey—the wins, the losses, the metrics, and the learnings—openly with your community. It's counterintuitive for many founders who are used to operating in stealth mode.

But the benefits are real:

- **Faster feedback loops**: You learn what resonates with users immediately
- **Community building**: Your early users become invested in your success
- **Accountability**: Public commitments create healthy pressure to ship
- **Marketing**: Your journey itself becomes content that attracts customers

## The Challenges

It's not all upside. Building in public comes with risks:

- **Competitive exposure**: Your competitors can see your strategy
- **Pressure to perform**: Bad metrics are public too
- **Time investment**: Creating content takes time away from building

## What Works

The most successful "build in public" founders I've worked with:

1. **Set boundaries**: Not everything needs to be public
2. **Stay authentic**: Share real struggles, not just wins
3. **Be consistent**: Regular updates build momentum
4. **Engage deeply**: Respond to feedback and build relationships

## The Bottom Line

Building in public isn't for everyone, but for the right founders with the right products, it can be a powerful growth lever. The key is being intentional about what you share and why.
