# The Founder's Guide to Seed Fundraising

Raising your first institutional round can feel overwhelming. After helping dozens of founders through this process, here's what you need to know.

## Before You Start

Don't start fundraising until you have:

- **A compelling story**: Why now? Why you? Why this?
- **Some traction**: It doesn't need to be revenue, but you need evidence of progress
- **A clear use of funds**: Investors want to know how you'll use their money
- **6+ months runway**: Never fundraise from a position of desperation

## The Process

A typical seed raise follows this timeline:

### Weeks 1-2: Preparation
- Refine your pitch deck
- Build your target investor list
- Get warm introductions

### Weeks 3-6: First Meetings
- Initial pitches and feedback
- Iterate on your story
- Build momentum

### Weeks 7-10: Deep Dives
- Partner meetings
- Due diligence
- Reference calls

### Weeks 11-12: Closing
- Term sheet negotiations
- Legal documents
- Wire transfers

## Common Mistakes

Watch out for these pitfalls:

1. **Talking to too few investors**: You need volume to create competition
2. **Not preparing for diligence**: Have your data room ready early
3. **Optimizing for valuation**: Terms matter more than price
4. **Ignoring investor quality**: Choose partners carefully

## Key Metrics

Seed investors typically look for:

- **Market size**: $1B+ TAM
- **Team**: Domain expertise and complementary skills
- **Product**: Clear value proposition and early validation
- **Traction**: 20-30% MoM growth (if you have revenue)

## My Advice

Focus on building a great business. Fundraising is a means to an end, not the end itself. The best fundraises happen when you have momentum and options.

And remember: No is not forever. Many of the best investments I've made were to companies I initially passed on.
